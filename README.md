# Temperature_Heatmap-API-gmaps
In this project, I  average temperature information by fortnight along an established sea trade route between Melbourne and Singapore over the past 5 years. This data will then be plotted into a graph using google maps API for easy viewing.
## Important notes:
put your API key for gmaps and world weather online to make it work
